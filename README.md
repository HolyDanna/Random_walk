# Random_walk
Random Walk using the RNG I created, developped for a school assignment

To use it, just launch the modele.py through a console : `python modele.py`

The user can chose the number of steps, as well as the type of walk (pure random, random with no-going back, and self-avoidance aka never going back on your tracks)

**Take care as setting a high number of steps for self-avoiding walk can make the program take a lot of time.**
